# WDI Daily Code Challenges

## Intro

During your 12 weeks in WDI, your instructors will be helping you learn tons of coding knowledge and skills using a proven approach where each lesson typically includes a mixture of:

- Instructor lecture & demonstration
- Instructor/student code alongs
- In-lesson student exercises

However, true learning doesn't take place until students practice what they've been taught. In fact, it's not uncommon for students to take 7 to 10 days of applying a particular concept before they are truly "comfortable" with it.

To provide practice in class, many lessons are followed with post-lesson labs. And of course, there's project week, where students often say they learn the most.

To provide additional practice writing JavaScript functions to solve a specific task, you will be required to complete one code challenge per day, excluding project weeks (4 weeks X 5 days/wk = 20 days of no code challenges).

These code challenges are considered homework, and thus 80% of them must be completed in combination with other deliverable homework in order to receive a Certificate of Completion.

You may choose to do more than one per day, or none at all - just don't fall too far behind!

## Instructions

- All challenges have one or more tests that run when the `run-tests-by-opening-in-browser.html` file is opened in the browser. 
- By default, Jasmine (the testing framework) will run the tests in random order. To prevent this, click on the **Options** button on the near the top-right of the page and uncheck the _run tests in random order_ checkbox.
- Solve the challenges by writing functions in the `challenges.js` file only.  **DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER FILE.**
- Each code challenge requires writing a single function to solve.
- Be sure to name the function **exactly** as specified by the challenge.
- The default display shows only the challenges that are failing. To see an overall summary of all tests, click the "**Spec List**" link.
- Your instructors will be checking your progress from time-to-time. **Don't move any of the files from where they currently are in the class repo** - simply solve the challenges, commit your work, and `$ git push origin master`.
- After solving a challenge, feel free to check the solution(s) contained in `solutions.js`. If multiple solutions are provided, they are typically shown in increasing order of "elegance".
